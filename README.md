# CBPFCouplingPaperCodes

This repository provides an implementation of coupled conditional backward sampling particle filter (CCBPF) algorithms as described in: 

Joona Karjalainen, Anthony Lee, Sumeetpal S. Singh and Matti Vihola 2023. [Mixing time of the conditional backward sampling particle filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17572).

The codes run on Julia v1.0+.

The source codes of the CCBPF implementation and for the stochastic gradient maximum likelihood estimation are in the folder [src](src).

The codes for the experiments in the paper are in [paper-numerics](paper-numerics).
