# Codes for the experiments

* [plotFunctions.jl](plotFunctions.jl): Julia functions for plots in Strong mixing and Linear-Gaussian model (used by [analyseTorusModel.jl](analyseTorusModel.jl) and [analyseLgEstimates.jl](analyseLgEstimates.jl)).

## Strong mixing model

* [torusModel.jl](torusModel.jl): the model definition
* [runTorusModel.jl](runTorusModel.jl): Julia script that runs a batch of unbiased estimates with the torus model, with parameters given in the command line
* [torusCommandList.sh](torusCommandList.sh): Shell script that creates command lines for each of the different parameter/time horizon/algorithm combinations. Note: the commands should be run at the main directory, so that outputs get to `out`. (**NB: These commands take a long time to run, and were run on a cluster with compute time cap of 4 hours**)
* [analyseTorusModel.jl](analyseTorusModel.jl): Julia script that generates the plots in the paper from the outputs, after they have been run

## Linear-Gaussian model

* [lgModel.jl](lgModel.jl): the model definition
* [runLgEstimates.jl](runLgEstimates.jl): Julia script that runs a batch of unbiased estimates with the torus model, with parameters given in the command line
* [lgEstimatesCommandlist.jl](lgEstimatesCommandlist.sh): Shell script that creates command lines for the first linear-Gaussian model test (Commands must be run at the main directory) (**NB: These commands, and the commands created by the following two scripts, take a long time to run, and were run on a cluster with compute time cap of 8 hours**)
* [lgEstimates2Commandlist.jl](lgEstimates2Commandlist.sh): Shell script that creates command lines for the second linear-Gaussian model test (Commands must be run at the main directory)
* [lgEstimates3Commandlist.jl](lgEstimates3Commandlist.sh): Shell script that creates command lines for the third linear-Gaussian model test (Commands must be run at the main directory)
* [analyseLgEstimates.jl](analyseLgEstimates.jl): Julia script that generates the plots in the paper from the output after running the commands generated by the three shell scripts above
* [lgDemoTraces.jl](lgDemoTraces.jl): Julia script which generates the plot visualising how the different couplings develop over iterations.

## Stochastic volatility with leverage

* [sv/msci_switzerland.csv](sv/msci_switzerland.csv): MSCI Switzerland data (`data(MSCISwitzerland)`from R package [AER](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/index.html))
* [sv/svModelGradient.jl](sv/svModelGradient.jl): Model and gradient function definitions
* [sv/testMsci.jl](sv/testMsci.jl): Common setup for MLE tests
* [sv/testMsciIIC_Adam.jl](sv/testMsciIIC_Adam.jl): The MLE test run with IIC forward coupling
* [sv/testMsciJIC_Adam.jl](sv/testMsciJIC_Adam.jl): The MLE test run with JIC forward coupling
* [sv/testMsciIMC_Adam.jl](sv/testMsciIMC_Adam.jl): The MLE test run with IMC forward coupling
* [sv/testMsciJMC_Adam.jl](sv/testMsciJMC_Adam.jl): The MLE test run with JMC forward coupling
* [sv/testMsciPlots.jl](sv/testMsciPlots.jl): Create plots in the paper after running all four `testMsci???_Adam.jl` above
